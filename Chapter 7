##### Chapter 7: Doomsday

- Aria awoke for the first time on a new day. She opened her eyes to tomorrow and found that it was quite lovely. She ate and drank and laughed and smiled and "sang" as her "companions" called it. She was still quite foreign to what they called kissing but she enjoyed hugging, she really enjoyed joking and the activity they called dancing. Crow and others would bring food from the green city, with walls of cannibal bodies and silent clanking and empty voices and lost souls.

- The world was inverted and at odds with what she once new. Instead of looking down fiddlers looked up. Instead of fiddlers fiddling she saw fiddlers playing, and fiddlers were not even called fiddlers, they were called human beings. They had names of their own choosing and spent time however they saw fit. What a strange world, with its golden infinity the bodys hanging from a green monstrosity not so far in the distance.

- Aria awoke without routine, she had no where to go and nothing in particular to do. With this weighing heavily on her mind she could do nothing but first try to assimilate her old routine into the new. she looked for her things rummaged them up in her sack and began the quest to look for food. Instead of life tokens, the food was free, which was strange, if the food was free than why would we need to fid.....oh yes thought aria, there is no fiddling here. Aria ate a great breakfast of ham and potatoes and sausage and french toast with tea and fruit and coffee with a few small pastries. After her fill her thoughts drifted to more "crass" pleasures mainly the clock. She admired its resilience and was intrigued by its rigid and autonomos truth, its nature seemed to be that of rock, unfaltering. Its mysterious seemed to be so intense that it would surely shake the fabric of the green city, if not the world. Her 2nd myster was to observe that of the "humans" they spent their days in joy and before long she found that she spent her days in a similar light, in a similar style and way of being.

- It was what they call one month since arias visit to the town, which they referred to as the golden city, and it was in this time that the green city took its retribution. The horizon sitting at the base of the green city inhaled, and violently exhaled its green, its exhaust came like a sudden storm wrapping the golden city in a smog unto which it would never recover, anyone that inhaled the fog would start violently shaking, blood spurting out of orficies. Lucky straglers including aria and crow fled the city into the vastness of the desert.

- With no rations due to their unexpect flight some companions turned to cannibalism once more.

- After a fight to the death with the cannibal party aria and crow are the last ones standing and eventually see a healthy woman and child walking casually through the desert, they make eye contact.
