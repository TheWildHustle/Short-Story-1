##### Chapter 4: The Clock

Aria is jolted awake by the home alarm.

- Alarm signals her to go to work

- She goes to the ration machine accidentily steps on a bunch of fallen energy tokens, dumps all of her leftovers into the leftover recepticle and selects the orange breakfast button. The machine opens and reveals a tray containing bacon eggs ham steak oatmeal cereal coffee oatmeal grits with butter a variety of teas fruits and cheeses a smoothie one bottle of purified water, orange juice apple juice grape juice danishes, strudels and a colorado omlette with a side of salsa guacomole and sour cream.

- Rides the black train with the friendlies on the way to her fiddler station, this time two friendliess interrogate her about her square peg performance, boast about being a better person than her, sweatily and greedily ask if she wants to hang out some time. An offer which she declines, which confuses the friendlies, they look at her up and down, look at each other and ask again as though she misheard them. She says no again, and one of the friendlies garners a bit of rage the other astonishment, they leave to their own devices after explaining once again that they are better than her and look to find a better fiddler. The interaction again causes stress and throwup.

- Aria makes it on time to attendence where dragger 58 (probably her best friend) congratulates her on the attendance in sarcasm, which aria honored and cherished more than he would ever know. He gives her her usual fiddling equipment (plastic squares that go into a square recepticles colored red baby blue yellow and orange) The baby blue squares go into the baby blue recepticles, they hand her a light plastic mallet to bang on the squares going into the hole if they dont fit. They always fit, not once has a square peg not been able to fit into a square recepticle.

- After 3 hours of fiddling aria is granted a 1 hour lunch break

- Which she spends on a rooftop munching away at her leftover rations playing with her puzzle and occasionally staring up at the unobstructed beautiful sky.

- She solves the puzzle and it comes apart, inside of the puzzle is a clock. What is this another puzzle she thinks? fascinated by the items shape color and..............What in the world. Moving pieces with numbers and lines. playing with it to see how the puzzle works, her leftover rations lay forgotton on the dirt, 2 hours pass and aria is still fascintated by the new puzzle, drager 58 comes to check on her after 2 hours like usual, comes up the ladder with his usual manufactured anger, sees the clock and lets out a blood curdling scream. Approaches aria like she's holding a bomb, pulls out a black sack of which aria has never seen, and demands aria give him the "clock". Quick aria, this isnt right, please i'm trying to help you, give me the clock. He lunges, slips on a banana falls off the top of the balcony and dies. Aria runs back to work, puts baby blue square pegs into baby blue square holes with a gusto, and even uses the tiny plastic hammer for good measure. When the black train bell rings she inconspicously escapes to a private location puts her coat without putting her arms through and walks with her hands behind her back and walks with a hard limp. The friendlies on the black train mostly ignore her, she runs off the train with immense energy, finds an unoccupied home and goes to sleep while staring at the clock wondering of its importance, wondering about the black bag, wondering about why everything around her seemed dangerous except this, when in awoke such viscous anger and bewilderment in the now dead dragger, her now just realized only friend.
