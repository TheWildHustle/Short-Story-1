##### Chapter 1: An Introduction to Aria

- In the dark, soot-filled lower districts of ATOD, the clanking sound of gears and the steady hum of machinery is the city's lifeblood.

- Aria is alone. The sky is beautiful, clear and unobstructed. It was almost past 2 and she was sitting on the roof of an abondoned building working through an apple and crossword puzzle. Unfazed by the clanking of metals shouts and general bussyness of the city she new her reprieve would not last long. Soon the draggers would come and force her into more mindless fiddling.

- "Fiddler 78?" said a husky voice from below, "Aria?" Aria recognized the voice as John Dagarty, an unusually patient dragger (probably due to his lack of experience). Yes Dragger 209? "Oh come on Aria, we've been through this, you know your to report back to the job after you've eaten lunch, and on top of that - the voiced of john climbed up the latter as his delapidated form came into being from over the ladder" And on top of that "Why do you always come to such abandoned places? Do you really hate everyone that much, come on Aria"

- Without taking her eyes off of the puzzle nestled in her lap aria responded "Yes Dragger, I hate everyone that much. But don't worry I'll be back down in a minute after I'm finished with my puzzle"

- John with an insight aria didnt think he possesed spoke strange, unsettling words, "Why do you like puzzles so much?" Aria froze, "I mean, I see you working on these puzzles everyday with more focus than you put into your fiddling? What on earth do those puzzles give you that you cant get from fiddling" Aria ,still frozen, felt an urge to run, an urge to hit something to make something hurt, to be a victor and not a victim of the situation, for control. Taking her eyes from the puzzle she looked square at john, then raised her chin into the sky stared into the white and pink clouds draped across the orange hew of the sky. I think its my reason for being alive john.

- Aria climbed down from the top of the building with her finished puzzle in a backpack. "Hi would you like some meat?" Oh no "responded Aria but thanks for asking. Fiddler meat was becoming popular again. Your loss said fiddler 62. Aria scurreied through the rambounxios city, in a flurry that one might have confused for urgency. Where aria was goin, urgency was a crime similar to sin. The beuro really wanted to make sure the fiddlers didnt fiddle with agency or goal setting. Why would there be any point in rushing.

- Upon arriving to her fiddle station dragger 54 approached her "Oh look who decided to come back to work......hahahaha, alright its no problem, said the dragger with a smile and familiar leniency" Now we've got some easy work for you, "Thanks 54, what are we working on today?" The dragger faced contorted as though aria had just insulted his mother. "Its a joke Derek, Give me the pegs" Releived, the dragger returned with a box removed a lock from around his neck, and opened the box on aria's desk. Aria then proceeded to remove the hole block and pegs from the box. Aria took the round peg, and put it into the round hole. "Perfect" said the dragger with a smile that concealed triumph and success. He then left aria to finish her assignments. Aria sat back in her chair grabbed another round peg looked around and dropped it in the square hole. She turns and looks around again, nothing.
