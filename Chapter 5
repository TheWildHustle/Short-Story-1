##### Chapter 5: Fear

Aria going about her day and eventually running into crow

- Home to work and work to home. Aria's routine continued, The green of the city walls reflected her gaunt but whole figure. She grabbed a clean fiddlers uniform from out of the laundry bin, an began her routine. She'd learned many things within the past few routines, she now learned it best to avoid the black train altogether, as she found a closer home nearer to her fiddler station, the only caveat being that she would need travel a bit to find vending machines, which wasnt too much of a bother for her. Curiosities sprung from aria's mind like a fountain, with her friends death being the force which broke the pipe. Why did anyone take the black train, there were plenty of homes closer to work, seemed like most of them did this out of routine, "unquestioning routines and schedules, like pieces of the puzzle her friend so desperately tried to save her from" On her journey to work arias gaze drifted towards the sky as she wondered if she should heed his advice and throw the puzzle away, was it worth exploring her curiosity against the dying words of her only friend. Aria then caught a glimpse of a strange figure out of the corner of her eye, as everyone usually walked with their heads down, the figure would have been invisible to most. Keeping her eyes trained on the hastening figure, she noticed it seemed to be carrying a huge dilopidated sack (Struggling).

- Fiddling at work went by as fiddling normally did. She sat back in her comfortable fiddling chair and drank her delicious fiddling coffee, she reclined back in its soft yet firm memory foam with its perfectly adjusted neck and head rest, hit the massage button to lessen the strain on her two calves, and began an intense days work of fiddling.

- Lunch arrived, with her puzzle already cracked aria thought of inspecting her "prize" at a familiar secluded rooftop, but couldnt quite bring herself to it. Jaded from her past experience and not sure where to spend her break aria drifted towards a vending machine in the not so distant distance. Strangely enough as aria walked towards the vending machines, she noticed everyone else walking and without a limp, she looked around and saw almost all of the fiddlers and draggers with full limbs all attached and rightly swinging and swaying, which was strange, because most of the people on the black train had at least one dismemberment. They hadnt come into contact with the friendlies? As aria continued to look around in slight bewilderment she saw the crow like figure again, this time with a distinctly different lopsided bag of things, with nothing else to do, aria began walking to the figure, which was another strangety as she never walked toward anyone.

- As aria began to get closer to the figure, she saw the figure glance over its shoulder stop in its tracks frozen almost, and begin walking a little faster. Aria increased her speed to be just a bit faster than his, as to catch up and inquire as to what he was doing? Crow, after a few more feet glanced over his shoulder again, and booked it. Aria in response, without quite knowing why proceeded with the chase.

- Lost and alone aria is awestruck. She had not only never been to this part of the city, but it looked as though there was an exit to outside. Strangely enough aria had never thought about what may lay beyond the city, and doubted that anyone else did. While walking closer a big sign lay above a door which read in plain english, Exit. This filled aria with dread, she fell to her knees, it was at this moment she new somehting was horribly wrong. After a few moments aria stumbled closer to the exit which was an open door revealing the entirety of what was outside, and it looked golden, golden yet dilapedated and uneven almost like the bag the stranger was carrying. as she walked closer to the exit, she stood by and touched its framing, inspecting it to see if it was real, or delusion. She was hungry. She ate her food and remembered taht she was on lunch break, without thinking she stood up and began to head towards her fiddler station, and then horror, and then fear, and then tears. She hadnt even realized that she was walking towards her station until she had taken a few steps. What was this automation she thought. Glancing out of the exit once more aria saw a beautiful land of gold, shifting her focus towards the city she saw dirty green with a train of happily dismembered victims floating overhead. She ran out of the exit while holding her breathe, and then. Nothing happened.
