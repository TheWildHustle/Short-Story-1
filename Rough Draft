#### Part I: Friend

##### Chapter 1: An Introduction to Aria

- In the dark, soot-filled lower districts of ATOD, the clanking sound of gears and the steady hum of machinery is the city's lifeblood.

- Aria is alone. The sky is beautiful, clear and unobstructed. It was almost past 2 and she was sitting on the roof of an abondoned building working through an apple and crossword puzzle. Unfazed by the clanking of metals shouts and general bussyness of the city she new her reprieve would not last long. Soon the draggers would come and force her into more mindless fiddling.

- "Fiddler 78?" said a husky voice from below, "Aria?" Aria recognized the voice as John Dagarty, an unusually patient dragger (probably due to his lack of experience). Yes Dragger 209? "Oh come on Aria, we've been through this, you know your to report back to the job after you've eaten lunch, and on top of that - the voiced of john climbed up the latter as his delapidated form came into being from over the ladder" And on top of that "Why do you always come to such abandoned places? Do you really hate everyone that much, come on Aria"

- Without taking her eyes off of the puzzle nestled in her lap aria responded "Yes Dragger, I hate everyone that much. But don't worry I'll be back down in a minute after I'm finished with my puzzle"

- John with an insight aria didnt think he possesed spoke strange, unsettling words, "Why do you like puzzles so much?" Aria froze, "I mean, I see you working on these puzzles everyday with more focus than you put into your fiddling? What on earth do those puzzles give you that you cant get from fiddling" Aria ,still frozen, felt an urge to run, an urge to hit something to make something hurt, to be a victor and not a victim of the situation, for control. Taking her eyes from the puzzle she looked square at john, then raised her chin into the sky stared into the white and pink clouds draped across the orange hew of the sky. I think its my reason for being alive john.

- Aria climbed down from the top of the building with her finished puzzle in a backpack. "Hi would you like some meat?" Oh no "responded Aria but thanks for asking. Fiddler meat was becoming popular again. Your loss said fiddler 62. Aria scurreied through the rambounxios city, in a flurry that one might have confused for urgency. Where aria was goin, urgency was a crime similar to sin. The beuro really wanted to make sure the fiddlers didnt fiddle with agency or goal setting. Why would there be any point in rushing.

- Upon arriving to her fiddle station dragger 54 approached her "Oh look who decided to come back to work......hahahaha, alright its no problem, said the dragger with a smile and familiar leniency" Now we've got some easy work for you, "Thanks 54, what are we working on today?" The dragger faced contorted as though aria had just insulted his mother. "Its a joke Derek, Give me the pegs" Releived, the dragger returned with a box removed a lock from around his neck, and opened the box on aria's desk. Aria then proceeded to remove the hole block and pegs from the box. Aria took the round peg, and put it into the round hole. "Perfect" said the dragger with a smile that concealed triumph and success. He then left aria to finish her assignments. Aria sat back in her chair grabbed another round peg looked around and dropped it in the square hole. She turns and looks around again, nothing.

#### Chapter 2: The Black Train

- The city is dipped in red, as the train screeches around corners and loops aria's mind drifts to her puzzle. as it often did. Aria had been alone all her life, which was an oddity to the rest of her community. Her isolation was self induced, she was often thought of as disagreeable or angry at the world. People closest to her would harp on "happiness". She wished she could be like them, but she was satisfied with what she was satisfied with.

- "How many square pegs did you fit into the square holes" Aria snapped out of her slight daze and turned toward the raspy voice to her left. "Eight thousand nine hundred and fourty two" "Ha!" rasped the unknown fiddler "I've put 39 thousand six hundrud and thirty eight square pegs in, that means I'm better than you" Aria"I suppose so" replied aria with the least amount of disdain she could muster.

- Unknown fiddler: which station are you getting off at? Aria: station 78 Unknown fiddler: Aww jeeze really? The fiddler looked suspiciously of aria Aria pulls out her station 78 ID card Unknown fiddler: Wow you must be the luckiest fiddler in atod with peg numbers that low and a place in the nice part of town (Fiddlers living at 50 and below are often "winners" of cannibalism) Aria Shrugged Aria: I guess so.

- The Unknown fiddler walked away in slight confusion but otherwise purposeful searching Aria sat back in her seat, as the goosebumps that spread through her body began to settle. The man was checking to see if he could eat her once she left the train. Women were easy winners of cannibalism and abuse To see a women riding the black train with all limbs and no visible signs of torture and abuse was an oddity. This made Getting "Checked" by "Friendly" Fiddlers a common occurence.

- But strangly enough, the situation always prompted a vile bodily reaction in her. "This" she said "is probably what seperates me the most from the others" Not wanting to be a friendly fiddler, and not aqueiscing to numerous befriending attempts made her something of a freak, an outcast, not wanting to be a productive fiddler made her a loser, enjoying puzzles made her look retarded. And clinging on to life made her a coward.

- As the black train halted aria gripped her bag containing the homeade 78 tag stood on her two feet and began exiting the train. Her last glance of the passengers revealed that the unknown friendly had found an eager women fiddler with two missing hands to accompany him deeper within the city. Aria stepped one foot off of the train and threw up in her mouth, this was a usual occurence, that and the headaches, that and the general fear and confusion. As no remedy to her ailments could be found on level 78, these were ever present symptoms with no meaning or cure behind them.

##### Chapter 3: Home

I cant wait to get home, thought aria. The fiddling had tired her to the point of extreme exhaustion. It was always curious to aria, how the fiddling and black train always seemed to take more of a tole on her than others. She lifted her glued eyes from the slime ridden ground of 78 sideways as to peak towards some of the surrounding area. Skipping and laughter, song and praise of the honorable. Celeberation and cheering, sex and fantastic entertainment. Why was she the only one whom the aformentioned activities drained. Satisfied with her glance she glued her eyes back to the metal watching one whole foot after whole foot step closer to something that she might consider home. An open door appeared after a mile and a half, which was decent luck. she pushes the door open but unexpectedly interrupts a hobbled boy and girl. Aria steps through the door

Aria: Hello

Aria begins unpacking her things and settles in a corner near the murky window to the right.

Hobled 1: Hey, how was the fiddling

After a few seconds of trying to understand the meaning of the question, and another few seconds of trying to come up with a suitable answer

Aria: good

Hobbled 2: Wow, thats great. Well looks like we're off to fiddle. Cant Wait!

As the hobbled couple leaves home, aria had a sudden curious thought "What if I found a place that only I was able to enter and leave" With a hurried shake of her head she resisted the thought. And a familiar guilt and disgust arose, more throw up in the mouth.

She would need to eat before her time of solitude

She opened her backpack and pulled out a life energy token

Walked out of the home to the community vending machine and restrooms. She inserted one life energy token and was rewarded with

- A new york strip steak cooked at a perfect medium rare with a red wine sauce, with garlic mashed potatoes turkey gravy, freshly steamed brocolli, an apple pie, a bottle of 30 year old barrel aged wine, fresh coffee beans a couple of fancy cheeses 2 bottles of purified water and a fruit tray.

- When reaching for her life tokens she realized that she dropped a few on the ground. "welp" she thought. Not really worth bending over to pick them up. Every day fiddling gave aria 20 life tokens, picking up dirty tokens didnt really make sense, as she would need to wipe them down before throwing them in a bag with the others.

- After a hurried pace back home aria began nimbling on her rations while as a smile began on her face. It was time for her puzzle. This was without a doubt the best thing about life, she opened her bag and pulled out the square figure. Multicolored and modular the cube was an endless source of enjoyment.

- More description of the rubicks cube and a hint at it being gifted to her) (Goes to sleep after pondering why she enjoys the puzzle so much)

##### Chapter 4: The Clock

Aria is jolted awake by the home alarm.

- Alarm signals her to go to work

- She goes to the ration machine accidentily steps on a bunch of fallen energy tokens, dumps all of her leftovers into the leftover recepticle and selects the orange breakfast button. The machine opens and reveals a tray containing bacon eggs ham steak oatmeal cereal coffee oatmeal grits with butter a variety of teas fruits and cheeses a smoothie one bottle of purified water, orange juice apple juice grape juice danishes, strudels and a colorado omlette with a side of salsa guacomole and sour cream.

- Rides the black train with the friendlies on the way to her fiddler station, this time two friendliess interrogate her about her square peg performance, boast about being a better person than her, sweatily and greedily ask if she wants to hang out some time. An offer which she declines, which confuses the friendlies, they look at her up and down, look at each other and ask again as though she misheard them. She says no again, and one of the friendlies garners a bit of rage the other astonishment, they leave to their own devices after explaining once again that they are better than her and look to find a better fiddler. The interaction again causes stress and throwup.

- Aria makes it on time to attendence where dragger 58 (probably her best friend) congratulates her on the attendance in sarcasm, which aria honored and cherished more than he would ever know. He gives her her usual fiddling equipment (plastic squares that go into a square recepticles colored red baby blue yellow and orange) The baby blue squares go into the baby blue recepticles, they hand her a light plastic mallet to bang on the squares going into the hole if they dont fit. They always fit, not once has a square peg not been able to fit into a square recepticle.

- After 3 hours of fiddling aria is granted a 1 hour lunch break

- Which she spends on a rooftop munching away at her leftover rations playing with her puzzle and occasionally staring up at the unobstructed beautiful sky.

- She solves the puzzle and it comes apart, inside of the puzzle is a clock. What is this another puzzle she thinks? fascinated by the items shape color and..............What in the world. Moving pieces with numbers and lines. playing with it to see how the puzzle works, her leftover rations lay forgotton on the dirt, 2 hours pass and aria is still fascintated by the new puzzle, drager 58 comes to check on her after 2 hours like usual, comes up the ladder with his usual manufactured anger, sees the clock and lets out a blood curdling scream. Approaches aria like she's holding a bomb, pulls out a black sack of which aria has never seen, and demands aria give him the "clock". Quick aria, this isnt right, please i'm trying to help you, give me the clock. He lunges, slips on a banana falls off the top of the balcony and dies. Aria runs back to work, puts baby blue square pegs into baby blue square holes with a gusto, and even uses the tiny plastic hammer for good measure. When the black train bell rings she inconspicously escapes to a private location puts her coat without putting her arms through and walks with her hands behind her back and walks with a hard limp. The friendlies on the black train mostly ignore her, she runs off the train with immense energy, finds an unoccupied home and goes to sleep while staring at the clock wondering of its importance, wondering about the black bag, wondering about why everything around her seemed dangerous except this, when in awoke such viscous anger and bewilderment in the now dead dragger, her now just realized only friend.

---

#### Part II: Green

Explanation: Aria is now more cautious about the world around her as she suspects somthing is awry. She continues the routine that she normally sets upon, but one day she randomly sees a character who is not going to the fiddling. The first reveal of the character should be in chapter one. She watches the character a bit more intensly than she did last. The next time she sees this character she decides to follow as her curiosisty cant be contained. The character now known as the fearcrow starts running away when realized that hes being followed. Aria not sure why the character is running begins her chase,

-she has fun with the chase as crow is obviously terrified and running for his life. She loses herself and then realizes that she doesnt know where she is, she loses the crow and then becomes wrought with fear and uncertainty herself. It looks like she is outside everything that she knows. She has arrived at the unknown. She sees people huddled in groups which is strange, she sees people who arent dismembered which is strange, she see walks through the shanty town in a state of confustion, wondering why people werent fiddling, wondering why people where smiling wondering why she felt good inside. She eventually finds the crow who at this point has his finger pointed at her directing some sort of authority towards her. She is detained and questioned, and eventually let go because she is deemed to be curious enough to coexist with the rest of the population, and the crow is meant to be her guide. Crow apologizes for his fear explains how he wish he had a heart, instead he goes halfway into the city to enlighten the others but always manages to run away in fear, fear of rejection, fear of reprisal. "The Green city" foments a gas that poisons 75% of the shanty towns population, the survivers forma caravan to band together and run towards freedom, after a while the only survivors are aria and crow, who now make there journey deeper into the unknown to find anything that isnt "green".

- The fiddlers are contributing to the building of nerve gas

- The green city conducts routine wipeouts of the surrounding area, because people have a tendency towards curiousity and freedom.

- The scarecrow arch mixed with the tinman "If he only had a heart"

- Outside is gold - dessert

- A bunch of life tokens are given away so that stragglers can come about them easier, tying them to the green city, as the outside area is a barren dessert

##### Chapter 5: Fear

Aria going about her day and eventually running into crow

- Home to work and work to home. Aria's routine continued, The green of the city walls reflected her gaunt but whole figure. She grabbed a clean fiddlers uniform from out of the laundry bin, an began her routine. She'd learned many things within the past few routines, she now learned it best to avoid the black train altogether, as she found a closer home nearer to her fiddler station, the only caveat being that she would need travel a bit to find vending machines, which wasnt too much of a bother for her. Curiosities sprung from aria's mind like a fountain, with her friends death being the force which broke the pipe. Why did anyone take the black train, there were plenty of homes closer to work, seemed like most of them did this out of routine, "unquestioning routines and schedules, like pieces of the puzzle her friend so desperately tried to save her from" On her journey to work arias gaze drifted towards the sky as she wondered if she should heed his advice and throw the puzzle away, was it worth exploring her curiosity against the dying words of her only friend. Aria then caught a glimpse of a strange figure out of the corner of her eye, as everyone usually walked with their heads down, the figure would have been invisible to most. Keeping her eyes trained on the hastening figure, she noticed it seemed to be carrying a huge dilopidated sack (Struggling).

- Fiddling at work went by as fiddling normally did. She sat back in her comfortable fiddling chair and drank her delicious fiddling coffee, she reclined back in its soft yet firm memory foam with its perfectly adjusted neck and head rest, hit the massage button to lessen the strain on her two calves, and began an intense days work of fiddling.

- Lunch arrived, with her puzzle already cracked aria thought of inspecting her "prize" at a familiar secluded rooftop, but couldnt quite bring herself to it. Jaded from her past experience and not sure where to spend her break aria drifted towards a vending machine in the not so distant distance. Strangely enough as aria walked towards the vending machines, she noticed everyone else walking and without a limp, she looked around and saw almost all of the fiddlers and draggers with full limbs all attached and rightly swinging and swaying, which was strange, because most of the people on the black train had at least one dismemberment. They hadnt come into contact with the friendlies? As aria continued to look around in slight bewilderment she saw the crow like figure again, this time with a distinctly different lopsided bag of things, with nothing else to do, aria began walking to the figure, which was another strangety as she never walked toward anyone.

- As aria began to get closer to the figure, she saw the figure glance over its shoulder stop in its tracks frozen almost, and begin walking a little faster. Aria increased her speed to be just a bit faster than his, as to catch up and inquire as to what he was doing? Crow, after a few more feet glanced over his shoulder again, and booked it. Aria in response, without quite knowing why proceeded with the chase.

- Lost and alone aria is awestruck. She had not only never been to this part of the city, but it looked as though there was an exit to outside. Strangely enough aria had never thought about what may lay beyond the city, and doubted that anyone else did. While walking closer a big sign lay above a door which read in plain english, Exit. This filled aria with dread, she fell to her knees, it was at this moment she new somehting was horribly wrong. After a few moments aria stumbled closer to the exit which was an open door revealing the entirety of what was outside, and it looked golden, golden yet dilapedated and uneven almost like the bag the stranger was carrying. as she walked closer to the exit, she stood by and touched its framing, inspecting it to see if it was real, or delusion. She was hungry. She ate her food and remembered taht she was on lunch break, without thinking she stood up and began to head towards her fiddler station, and then horror, and then fear, and then tears. She hadnt even realized that she was walking towards her station until she had taken a few steps. What was this automation she thought. Glancing out of the exit once more aria saw a beautiful land of gold, shifting her focus towards the city she saw dirty green with a train of happily dismembered victims floating overhead. She ran out of the exit while holding her breathe, and then. Nothing happened.

##### Chapter 6: Gold

Aria's experience in the shantytown outside of the city

- Nothing happened. No draggers running to take her away, No alarms or feelings of guilt. Maybe feelings of dissapointment, such an action should afford an individual something a bit more climactic, It was hot. Aria walked and walked and before long looked back at the city. She gasped the outside of the citys walls were decorated with the human body parts, a huge machine churned around the city nailing dismemberded bodyparts against the wall.

- Aria walked further and saw what appeared to be a group of 100 or so fiddlers, she walked towards them, and in her suprise once they spotted her, an applause broke out. Upon closer inspection, these were no ordinary fiddlers. They held their head and gaze upwards and not down, they wore smiles, put their bodys close together like they were holding each other as to stop one from falling even though they all appeared to have most limbs intact. They and laughed, and made strange melodic sounds with their mouths, even using other objects to create mesmerizing noises as well. They had feasts of Steak and potatoes, Beer and wine and roasted chicken and ham, fruits and cheeses and breads and pies and cakes. The jumped around to the noises and touched lips together. (Which aria thought was very strange).

- After The feast aria ran into the crow.

- The crow was a fearful creature, it was a strange terror that tormented this one. Surrounded by the happy and thankful, he was miserable and lonelier than aria had remembered being even after losing her only "Friend". Crow was huddled in a corner rocking back and forth nibbling on a piece of meat while looking through readings. As she approached, crow looked up, in his eyes flashed dissapointment. Why such sorrow after seeing me inquired aria. Everyone whos seen me arrive here has expressed joy and welcome. Crow said "I should have walked you through the gate myself but I was too afraid" I'm ashamed because I wonder the city everyday and everyday I have the opportunity to save lost souls from absolute carnage, but I had a bad experience and fear that they would reject me, fear that they would snitch on me and subject me to the wrath i'd been trying to spare them from. I hate myself for my cowardice, I dont want to become a martry, but at the same time, in this life it is probably better to become a martyr than to become a bystandard to horror and the destruction of man. Everyday I become the Monsters accomplice, their hate has become my guilt, Its is very easy as you see to walk through the gate, and most are just unkowingly and pointlessly fiddling away with whatever the demons force them to fiddle and slave away with. They are running a cannibal farm where they raise humans to eat each other, I'm not sure how the system became that way, or what its true intentions might be, but from the bodys strewn across its surface its obvious to see that what they are doing is evil and corrupt and immoral and indecent and savage and nasty.

- "Obvious" though aria. This word was unsettling. It is obvious to see the tearing of ones own flesh and breaking of ones own bones and the tearing of ones own limbs as........destructive, especcially when done pointlessly, or unwittingly. It is obvious, she thought again. It is obvious that we should not spend our days mindlessly fiddling. But what should we spend our time focused on, what should we be doing with our days and nights.

- Not quite knowing why, aria took out the clock, and still in the midst of his speal the crows eyes began to fill with tears. Ah, he said. Looks like you've found time in more ways than one. He rolled up his sleave to reveal a clock attached to his wrist, aria was perplexed. And this is these, he said, are what we use to keep track of time. And what is time? Responded aria.

- Crows explanation of time, and of the time theives

- Aria went to sleep that night completed. As though weight had been lifted fromher shoulders, it was an unburdened sleep a welcomed sleep after truth seeking as crow called it, and joy and laughter as the others called it.

-

##### Chapter 7: Doomsday

- Aria awoke for the first time on a new day. She opened her eyes to tomorrow and found that it was quite lovely. She ate and drank and laughed and smiled and "sang" as her "companions" called it. She was still quite foreign to what they called kissing but she enjoyed hugging, she really enjoyed joking and the activity they called dancing. Crow and others would bring food from the green city, with walls of cannibal bodies and silent clanking and empty voices and lost souls.

- The world was inverted and at odds with what she once new. Instead of looking down fiddlers looked up. Instead of fiddlers fiddling she saw fiddlers playing, and fiddlers were not even called fiddlers, they were called human beings. They had names of their own choosing and spent time however they saw fit. What a strange world, with its golden infinity the bodys hanging from a green monstrosity not so far in the distance.

- Aria awoke without routine, she had no where to go and nothing in particular to do. With this weighing heavily on her mind she could do nothing but first try to assimilate her old routine into the new. she looked for her things rummaged them up in her sack and began the quest to look for food. Instead of life tokens, the food was free, which was strange, if the food was free than why would we need to fid.....oh yes thought aria, there is no fiddling here. Aria ate a great breakfast of ham and potatoes and sausage and french toast with tea and fruit and coffee with a few small pastries. After her fill her thoughts drifted to more "crass" pleasures mainly the clock. She admired its resilience and was intrigued by its rigid and autonomos truth, its nature seemed to be that of rock, unfaltering. Its mysterious seemed to be so intense that it would surely shake the fabric of the green city, if not the world. Her 2nd myster was to observe that of the "humans" they spent their days in joy and before long she found that she spent her days in a similar light, in a similar style and way of being.

- It was what they call one month since arias visit to the town, which they referred to as the golden city, and it was in this time that the green city took its retribution. The horizon sitting at the base of the green city inhaled, and violently exhaled its green, its exhaust came like a sudden storm wrapping the golden city in a smog unto which it would never recover, anyone that inhaled the fog would start violently shaking, blood spurting out of orficies. Lucky straglers including aria and crow fled the city into the vastness of the desert.

- With no rations due to their unexpect flight some companions turned to cannibalism once more.

- After a fight to the death with the cannibal party aria and crow are the last ones standing and eventually see a healthy woman and child walking casually through the desert, they make eye contact.

---

#### Part III: Family

Aria and crow find themselves wandering the dessert, with barely any idea of how to survive without the life tokens. They eventually find a group of 4 stragglers, a family. They call themselves a family which is a term aria's never heard, she watches the family unit and how they operate, crow and aria learn how to survive in the desert, aria and crow learn about love and sex, they learn how babies are made and of relations between man and woman. They learn about self defense and property rights, they learn of history, and aria remembers her clock and pulls it out. All characters outside of aria are astonished, and a little intimidated, time was just a theory to the family and crow, but now they had proof. She recalls what happened to her dragger friend, and how she came about the rubicks cube. A debate between the man in the family the crow and aria begins as to what should be done with their knowledge. The man says to leave the world be, the crow says to help the others, aria says to explore more. The draggers befall them, they fight and one of the kids dies. The man is befallen with intense rage, anger, and hatred, they spend some time recouping but the anger doesnt leave the man. He wishes his anger would leave and that he would stick to rationality instead of emotion, he wishes he had a brain. He sets out on a path with crow and aria, he wants to destroy the system, aria wants to explore, and crow wants to set people free.

- Lion archetype but wishes he had a brain instead of his emotion

##### Chapter 8: Mother

They first see a woman working with something in the distance, they are introduced to the family unit.

##### Chapter 9: Sovereignty

They learn how to eat, defend themselves and survive in the gold. They learn about sex and relations between man and woman. Aria reveals the clock and the three debate about their next moves.

##### Chapter 10: Rage

The draggers attack, and are reppeled but not before taking the life of the daughter, propelled into constant rage the man joins the other two in attempts to destroy the system

---

#### Part IV: Death

The three make their way back to the green city with plans of exploration, destruction, and saving

At the gate they run into the "tin men" who dont care about anything. Extremely nihlistic unmotivated and depressed characters who build fiddles for the fiddlers. They have to convince one of the tinmen to let them through the gate, but they're lazy and dont care and wishes they had motivation but oh well they dont. They spend months trying to motivate the tinman, the man still engraged is in constant contact with his family to make sure they're doing ok. The crow is making the most valient attempts at energizing the tinman and aria is searching for clues. She finds a something that will convince the tinman to act. The tinman opens the gate for them, and is destroyed, but with joy in his heart a smile on his face and an accomlished grin of self satisfaction and honor, the other tinmen see his sacrifice and are motivated to act in turn, forming a rebellion of the tinmen, The original is branded as a jesus christ type figure that died for their sins, they all aspire to his courage and willingness to act. The rebellion spreads like wildfire, the "enraged lion" is storming the gates destorying the system, the crow is preaching like a doomsday pastor about time and truth and honor, while denouncing the system and its despicable nature. Aria finds herself spying on the death eaters and listening to their plans, observing their attitudes lifestyles and methodologies.

- They need to control people because people are retarded

- Theyre better than other poeple because the other people are unworthy

- The world cant function without the death eaters

- Time is too complicated for people, not everyone will be able to tell time

- Not everyone is going to be able to afford a clock much less read from it

- The system has worked for hundreds of years they just need to regain control

- They are the arbiters of truth, truth is whatever they say it is

The clock was given to her by her father

It was not hundreds of years it was 40 - death eaters cant tell time themselves

They are unworthy of being arbiters of truth

The concept of time can be both basic and complicated but its important for man to know

We can put the clock in the cell phones

The death eaters dont do anything but provide death, which just naturally occurs to man

"Upon hearing arias words one of the death eaters gets up from his chair runs across the room and jumps out of the window, breaking the glass and spraying the room with shards, falling to his death"

The death eaters are behedded, their heads put on pikes and paraded through the street, they people sing songs of liberty and freedom and hope and honor, they vow to never be led astray, they love each other more intently, they begin to understand the importance of work and truth, of family and god. and then nihlism, cold rationality, and fear slowly creep in to suck the freedom out from everyones jowls once again. The eternal freedom arch.

##### Chapter 10: Tin City

Introduction to the tin men, the convincing and martyrdom of one of the tin men

##### Chapter 11: Rebellion

The fight for freedom against the death eaters and draggers erupts after the tin men see the sacrfice of one of their own. Each of the characters encounters with the green city, the lion and his fight, the crow and his saintdom, aria and the spying on the death eaters.

##### Chapter 12: Victory

The good guys win to fight another day, but the freedom arch is in constatnt pendulem swing which must be defended at all times.
