#### Chapter 2: The Black Train

- The city is dipped in red, as the train screeches around corners and loops aria's mind drifts to her puzzle. as it often did. Aria had been alone all her life, which was an oddity to the rest of her community. Her isolation was self induced, she was often thought of as disagreeable or angry at the world. People closest to her would harp on "happiness". She wished she could be like them, but she was satisfied with what she was satisfied with.

- "How many square pegs did you fit into the square holes" Aria snapped out of her slight daze and turned toward the raspy voice to her left. "Eight thousand nine hundred and fourty two" "Ha!" rasped the unknown fiddler "I've put 39 thousand six hundrud and thirty eight square pegs in, that means I'm better than you" Aria"I suppose so" replied aria with the least amount of disdain she could muster.

- Unknown fiddler: which station are you getting off at? Aria: station 78 Unknown fiddler: Aww jeeze really? The fiddler looked suspiciously of aria Aria pulls out her station 78 ID card Unknown fiddler: Wow you must be the luckiest fiddler in atod with peg numbers that low and a place in the nice part of town (Fiddlers living at 50 and below are often "winners" of cannibalism) Aria Shrugged Aria: I guess so.

- The Unknown fiddler walked away in slight confusion but otherwise purposeful searching Aria sat back in her seat, as the goosebumps that spread through her body began to settle. The man was checking to see if he could eat her once she left the train. Women were easy winners of cannibalism and abuse To see a women riding the black train with all limbs and no visible signs of torture and abuse was an oddity. This made Getting "Checked" by "Friendly" Fiddlers a common occurence.

- But strangly enough, the situation always prompted a vile bodily reaction in her. "This" she said "is probably what seperates me the most from the others" Not wanting to be a friendly fiddler, and not aqueiscing to numerous befriending attempts made her something of a freak, an outcast, not wanting to be a productive fiddler made her a loser, enjoying puzzles made her look retarded. And clinging on to life made her a coward.

- As the black train halted aria gripped her bag containing the homeade 78 tag stood on her two feet and began exiting the train. Her last glance of the passengers revealed that the unknown friendly had found an eager women fiddler with two missing hands to accompany him deeper within the city. Aria stepped one foot off of the train and threw up in her mouth, this was a usual occurence, that and the headaches, that and the general fear and confusion. As no remedy to her ailments could be found on level 78, these were ever present symptoms with no meaning or cure behind them.
