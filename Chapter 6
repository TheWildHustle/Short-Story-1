##### Chapter 6: Gold

Aria's experience in the shantytown outside of the city

- Nothing happened. No draggers running to take her away, No alarms or feelings of guilt. Maybe feelings of dissapointment, such an action should afford an individual something a bit more climactic, It was hot. Aria walked and walked and before long looked back at the city. She gasped the outside of the citys walls were decorated with the human body parts, a huge machine churned around the city nailing dismemberded bodyparts against the wall.

- Aria walked further and saw what appeared to be a group of 100 or so fiddlers, she walked towards them, and in her suprise once they spotted her, an applause broke out. Upon closer inspection, these were no ordinary fiddlers. They held their head and gaze upwards and not down, they wore smiles, put their bodys close together like they were holding each other as to stop one from falling even though they all appeared to have most limbs intact. They and laughed, and made strange melodic sounds with their mouths, even using other objects to create mesmerizing noises as well. They had feasts of Steak and potatoes, Beer and wine and roasted chicken and ham, fruits and cheeses and breads and pies and cakes. The jumped around to the noises and touched lips together. (Which aria thought was very strange).

- After The feast aria ran into the crow.

- The crow was a fearful creature, it was a strange terror that tormented this one. Surrounded by the happy and thankful, he was miserable and lonelier than aria had remembered being even after losing her only "Friend". Crow was huddled in a corner rocking back and forth nibbling on a piece of meat while looking through readings. As she approached, crow looked up, in his eyes flashed dissapointment. Why such sorrow after seeing me inquired aria. Everyone whos seen me arrive here has expressed joy and welcome. Crow said "I should have walked you through the gate myself but I was too afraid" I'm ashamed because I wonder the city everyday and everyday I have the opportunity to save lost souls from absolute carnage, but I had a bad experience and fear that they would reject me, fear that they would snitch on me and subject me to the wrath i'd been trying to spare them from. I hate myself for my cowardice, I dont want to become a martry, but at the same time, in this life it is probably better to become a martyr than to become a bystandard to horror and the destruction of man. Everyday I become the Monsters accomplice, their hate has become my guilt, Its is very easy as you see to walk through the gate, and most are just unkowingly and pointlessly fiddling away with whatever the demons force them to fiddle and slave away with. They are running a cannibal farm where they raise humans to eat each other, I'm not sure how the system became that way, or what its true intentions might be, but from the bodys strewn across its surface its obvious to see that what they are doing is evil and corrupt and immoral and indecent and savage and nasty.

- "Obvious" though aria. This word was unsettling. It is obvious to see the tearing of ones own flesh and breaking of ones own bones and the tearing of ones own limbs as........destructive, especcially when done pointlessly, or unwittingly. It is obvious, she thought again. It is obvious that we should not spend our days mindlessly fiddling. But what should we spend our time focused on, what should we be doing with our days and nights.

- Not quite knowing why, aria took out the clock, and still in the midst of his speal the crows eyes began to fill with tears. Ah, he said. Looks like you've found time in more ways than one. He rolled up his sleave to reveal a clock attached to his wrist, aria was perplexed. And this is these, he said, are what we use to keep track of time. And what is time? Responded aria.

- Crows explanation of time, and of the time theives

- Aria went to sleep that night completed. As though weight had been lifted fromher shoulders, it was an unburdened sleep a welcomed sleep after truth seeking as crow called it, and joy and laughter as the others called it.
